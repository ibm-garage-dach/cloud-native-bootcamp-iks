# Lab 1: Docker Introduction

## Prerequisites

This set of instructions requires that Docker is already installed and docker commands can be run from a bash shell. You can get more information at the [Docker website](https://docker.com/get-started).

**Note**: This demo assumes that you are running in a "clean" environment. Clean means that you have not used docker with the images in this demo. This is important for someone who is using docker for the first time, so they can see the activity as images are downloaded.

Another requirement is to have a way to execute http requests against the local workstation. As we are a bit bash heavy we assume curl here, but any other tool like postman will do the job as well.


## Working with docker

Launch a shell and confirm that docker is installed. The version number isn't particular important.

```bash
$ docker -v
Docker version 19.03.12, build 48a66213fe
```

As with all new computer things, it is obligatory that we start with "hello-world"

```bash
$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:4cf9c47f86df71d48364001ede3a4fcd85ae80ce02ebad74156906caff5378bc
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```

Notice the message Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally. First, you see that the image was automatically downloaded without any additional commands. Second, the version :latest was added to the name of the image. We did not specify a version for this image.

Rerun "hello-world". Notice that the image is not pulled down again. It already exists locally, so it is run.

```bash
$ docker run hello-world
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
[...]
```

It already exists locally and `docker images` will show us that image.

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY    TAG      IMAGE ID        CREATED        SIZE
hello-world   latest   bf756fb1ae65    2 mins ago     13.3kB
```

From where was the hello-world image pulled? Go to https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world/ (that is an underscore \_ character in the URL) and you can read about this image. Docker Hub is a repository that holds docker images for use. Docker Hub is not the only repository, IBM Cloud can also serve as a docker repository.

This image is atypical. When an image is run, it usually continues to run. The running image is called a container. Let us run a more typical image; this image contains the NoSQL database CouchDB.

We use the following parameters in docker run:

- -e allows to set environment variables
- -d runs the container in detached mode returning only the container ID
- -p <host port>:<container port> binds the container to the host port

```bash
$ docker run -d -p:5984:5984 -e COUCHDB_USER=admin -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password apache/couchdb:latest
Unable to find image 'apache/couchdb:latest' locally

Status: Downloaded newer image for apache/couchdb:latest
4de83b227b03bf17a42a1915d87928e310c44764ef9776083963276eb114e908
```

The output above was captured while the image was still downloading from docker-hub. When the download is done you don't see anything from the container, like with hello-world. Instead you see a long hex id like 4de83b227b03bf17a42a1915d87928e310c44764ef9776083963276eb114e908. This is the id of the container.

Here is how you would see the running container. Notice only the first part of that long hex id is displayed. Typically this is more than enough to uniquely identify that container. docker ps provides information about when the container was created, how long it has been running, the name of the image, as well as the name of the container. Note that each container must have a unique name. You can specify a name for each container as long it is unique.

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                 COMMAND   CREATED        STATUS       PORTS           NAMES
4de83b227b03   apache/couchdb:latest "tini.."  4 minutes ago  Up 4 minutes 4369/tcp [...]  eloquent_ardinghelli
```

To validate CouchDB is up an running execute a curl command against the exposed port. You should receive a JSON-based welcome message.

```bash
$ curl localhost:5984
{"couchdb":"Welcome","version":"3.1.1","git_sha":"ce596c65d","uuid":"509813e7f91cb260fb30039f7421abab","features":["access-ready","partitioned","pluggable-storage-engines","reshard","scheduler"],"vendor":{"name":"The Apache Software Foundation"}}
```

Create a new customer database with the following curl command.

```bash
$ curl -X PUT http://admin:password@localhost:5984/customer
{"ok":true}
```

Insert a customer entry to the database leveraging the following HTTP PUT request.

```bash
$ curl -X PUT http://admin:password@localhost:5984/customer/1 -d '{"firstName": "Hugo", "lastName": "Boss"}'
{"ok":true,"id":"1","rev":"1-b8745a7b645d3f29f0b19274bf63707b"}
```

To finalize our tests we will retrieve the created document from the customer database.

```bash
$ curl -X GET http://admin:password@localhost:5984/customer/1
{"_id":"1","_rev":"1-b8745a7b645d3f29f0b19274bf63707b","firstName":"Hugo","lastName":"Boss"}
```

Now let's clean up the environment. Start with stopping the container with the proper container id.

```bash
$ docker stop 4de83b227b03
4de83b227b03
```

Notice the image still exists. Go ahead and try to delete the CouchDB image with `docker rmi apache/couchdb`

```bash
$ docker rmi apache/couchdb
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference "apache/couchdb" (must force) - container 4de83b227b03 is using its referenced image 1916ea74a583
```

Oops, we can't delete the image until we remove the couchdb container. Note that `docker ps -a` will show us all the containers, not just the ones that are running.

```bash
$ docker ps -a
4de83b227b03   apache/couchdb:latest   "tini -- /docker-entâ€¦"   17 minutes ago   Exited (0) 4 minutes ago   eloquent_ardinghelli
```

With `docker rm <container id>` you can remove a container. Delete the couchdb container, delete the couchdb image and make sure it's gone.

```bash
$ docker rm 4de83b227b03
4de83b227b03

$ docker rmi apache/couchdb

**Congratulations, you have done your first steps with Docker.**


Optional Lab 1

If you want to build your own image you can checkout the [**/node_docker**](/node_docker) folder in this repository and build + test your own based on a simple Node.JS sample (look into the README for some hints).
