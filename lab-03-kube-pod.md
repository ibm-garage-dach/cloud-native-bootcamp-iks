# Lab 3: Kubernetes Pod Creation

## Prerequisites

You can retrieve metadata from your Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME             STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
10.134.237.212   Ready    <none>   3h18m   v1.17.11+IKS
10.134.237.244   Ready    <none>   3h18m   v1.17.11+IKS
10.134.237.245   Ready    <none>   3h19m   v1.17.11+IKS
```

Hint: make sure to select **more** on the Kubernetes YAML examples in above supporting information.

## Challenge to be solved

Write a pod definition named yoda-service-pod.yml. Then create a pod in the cluster using this definition to make sure it works.

The specifications of this pod are as follows:

- Use the bitnami/nginx container image.
- The container needs a containerPort of 80.
- Set the command to run ["nginx"]
- Pass in the ["-g", "daemon off;", "-q"] args to run nginx in quiet mode.
- Create the pod in the "dev-**your initials**" namespace.

### Verification

When you have completed this lab, use the following commands to validate your solution.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n dev-gw
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   1/1     Running   0          8s

$ kubectl describe pod nginx -n dev-gw
[...]
Events:
