## Challenge to be solved

Create a pod definition named `yoda-service-pod.yml`, and then create a pod in the cluster using this definition to make sure it works.

The specifications of this pod are as follows:

- The current image for the container is `bitnami/nginx`. You do not need a custom command or args.
- There is some configuration data the container will need:
```txt
yoda.baby.power=100000000
yoda.strength=10
```
- It will expect to find this data in a file at `/etc/yoda-service/yoda.cfg`. Store the configuration data in a ConfigMap called `yoda-service-config` and provide it to the container as a mounted volume.
- The container should expect to use `64Mi` of memory and `250m` CPU (use resource requests).
- The container should be limited to `128Mi` of memory and `500m` CPU (use resource limits).
- The container needs access to a database password in order to authenticate with a backend database server. The password is `0penSh1ftRul3s!`. It should be stored as a Kubernetes secret called `yoda-db-password` and passed to the container as an environment variable called `DB_PASSWORD`.
- The container will need to access the Kubernetes API using the ServiceAccount `yoda-sa`. Create the service account if it doesn’t already exist, and configure the pod to use it.
- Create the pod in the "dev-**your initials**" namespace.

### Verification

To verify your setup is complete, check /etc/yoda-service for the yoda.cfg file and use the cat command to check it’s contents.

```bash
$ kubectl exec -it yoda-service /bin/bash
$ cd /etc/yoda-service
$ cat yoda.cfg
```
